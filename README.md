![latest tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/STMicroelectronics/x-cube-azrtos-h7rs.svg?color=brightgreen)

With Azure RTOS complementing the extensive STM32Cube ecosystem providing free development tools, software bricks, and software expansion packages, STM32 users can also leverage the rich services of Azure RTOS, which meet the needs of tiny, smart, connected devices.

**X-CUBE-AZRT-H7RS** (Azure RTOS Software Expansion for STM32Cube) provides a full integration of **Microsoft Azure RTOS** in the STM32Cube environment for the STM32H7RS series of microcontrollers. Ready-to-run applicative examples are also provided for the *NUCLEO-H7S3L8*, *STM32H7S78-DK* evaluation boards, thus **reducing the learning curve** and ensuring a **smooth application development experience** with Azure RTOS and STM32H7RS MCUs.

The scope of this package covers the following Azure RTOS middleware: RTOS (***ThreadX***), USB Device and Host (***USBX***), File System including NOR/NAND memories support (***FileX*** and ***LevelX***) and Networking including Ethernet and WiFi media (***NetXDuo***).
